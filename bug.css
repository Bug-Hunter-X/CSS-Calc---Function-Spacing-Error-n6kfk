The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there can be unexpected behavior if you don't use spaces correctly around the operators (+, -, *, /).  Forgetting spaces can lead to the browser misinterpreting the calculation. For instance, `width:calc(100%-10px);` will likely fail, but `width:calc(100% - 10px);` will work correctly.
